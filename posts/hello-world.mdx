Have you ever come across a cool software project that got shut down because the company behind it went out of business?

Ever wish there was some way for this useful software to live on and continue to serve the public?

Today we've formed the Technology Extension Corporation ("TEC") to attempt to begin to address this issue. 
We are a California Nonprofit Public Benefit Corporation; we're working on getting our 501(c)(3) approval from the IRS.
Our EIN is 88-3851706.

Our first project is Medcorder, an app to help patients and their families understand complex medical appointments.
The company behind it, Medcorder, Inc., needed to shut its doors but thousands of patients were still counting on the
app to help manager their care. So the founder of Medcorder, David Weekly, decided
to create TEC to act as a non-profit steward for these kinds of projects.
